# Bitcoin_price_prediction
- This study is a university project focusing on the Bitcoin price forecasting using machine learning methods, which are then evaluated by MAE(mean absolute error) and RMSE(root mean square error).
- We performed EDA to analyse the bitcoin price for the last 9 years, i.e from 2014 to 2022.
- Four models are used here, Linear Regression, LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU.
- We try to find out the best model to predict Bitcoin price.
